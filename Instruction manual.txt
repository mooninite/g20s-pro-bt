This guide details how to update the firmware on a G20S Pro Bluetooth (G20SProBT) remote when the OK button is malfunctioning.

Before you begin, you'll need:

    An Android phone

Here's how to perform the update:

    Download the files: You'll need two files: an update application (.apk) and a firmware data file (.dat).

    Prepare the files:
        Create a folder named "G20BTSPLUS" on your phone's internal storage.
        Download the .dat file. It might be saved as a .txt file by default. Rename it back to .dat (original filename was HB9265_G20BTSPRO_OTA_V1.2.4_APP_1.2.2981.0207_BCD4BF72.dat if necessary, did not test)

    Pair the remote with your phone:
        Go to your phone's Settings app.
        Navigate to Bluetooth and select "Add Device."
        On the remote, press and hold the OK and Return buttons simultaneously for 3 sesconds. The device should appear on your phone's list.
        Note: The remote might not stay permanently connected. If you can't use the navigation buttons or the cursor appears instead, you might need to try with a different phone.

    Install the downloaded application (.apk) on your phone. WARNING: it comes from a unknown source. Use on your own risk.

    Run the application:
        Tap the upper button in the app.
        In the menu that appears, choose the first option.
        Browse and select the downloaded .dat file you placed in the "G20BTSPLUS" folder.

    Begin the update:
        Tap the lower button in the app.
        Select "G20SPro" from the options.
        The update process should now begin.
